# Contributors

This file is optional and repository-specific.

If a repository wants a contributor list, generate it from git history in that repository:

```bash
git shortlog -sne
```

Notes:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the organization-wide default policy file.
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` is informational only and is not a GitHub community health default.
- Avoid misspelling this file as `CONTRIBUTERS.md`.
